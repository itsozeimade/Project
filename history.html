Born in Benin City, Nigeria, and at such a young age attending school here in the U.S., she had high hopes in pursuing the american dream here in America. After getting her Bachelors at Kent State University, she became an adminstrator with the city of NY while still having her business as a side hustle. But overtime, after having her part-time business as a businesswoman, she decided it was time for her to retire and focus on her business full time, all thanks to her family, for which she gained knowledge from, to transform her well-known business.  </p>
